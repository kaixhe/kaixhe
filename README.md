# Hi, I'm learning Cloud Infrastructure 👋

Right now I’m spending a few months focused on **Cloud Operations**.
I mostly learn by building things and breaking them. Everything here is going to be the stuff I've actually worked on — scripts, labs, notes.

### What I'm working on
- AWS networking (VPCs, subnets, gateways) with Bash and maybe python
- Linux admin scripts and basic server work
- Planning to learn Terraform and Docker next

### Goal
Get a **Junior Cloud Support** or **NOC** role and learn even more on the job.
